# onTime_inTime
A group  project for the NYCDA.

The three of us create a Evil Alarm clock which will spamm the user to wake up.

Just on a side note:
We use Bcrypt for Mac this will mean that Windows users will have a problem with our NPM Install

In our code we use different API keys, these keys are saved in our envoirment and NOT on git.
This will mean the clock will not runn without these keys. 

Loads of code is commented out because of the fact to that we did not want to delete our progress.
Also we used the Facebook API log-in to sign-up for the app but this stopped working half way through our app so we switched
to a normal log-in with Bcrypt.

This project is open source, feel free to use the code, Fork us and share it but if you do please let us know or star us!
Just so we know our work is appriciated :)
